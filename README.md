# Supercut Studio

[![Supercut Studio demo video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/3iT7fVVm4Uc/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iT7fVVm4Uc)

A local SvelteKit app for browsing transcript/video buckets and rendering
supercuts. It can stitch phrase or regex matches, synthesize fake sentences,
songify clips, transcribe missing media with xAI STT, and browse/delete finished
renders.

## Requirements

- Node 22+
- `ffmpeg` on `PATH`
- `aubiopitch` on `PATH` for `/songify` (`brew install aubio`)
- `XAI_API_KEY` for `/transcribe` and `/supercut` AI regex suggestions
- One or more local media buckets under `./videos` by default
- Source videos downloaded into those buckets, for example with `yt-dlp`

Local `.env` files are loaded by Vite/SvelteKit. On boot, the app also tries to
hydrate missing env vars from `../syntax-transcripts-2026/.env`; override that
lookup with `SYNTAX_REPO_DIR=/abs/path` if needed.

## Media Layout

The app treats each direct child of the buckets root as one bucket. A valid
bucket has a `videos/` folder; `transcripts/` and `supercuts/` are created or
read when needed.

```txt
videos/                         # bucket root
  syntax/                       # bucket name
    videos/                     # source .mp4/.mkv/.mov/.webm/.avi and .mp3
    transcripts/                # word-level .json transcripts
    supercuts/                  # generated .mp4 renders
  another-channel/
    videos/
    transcripts/
    supercuts/
```

Set `SYNTAX_BUCKETS_DIR=/abs/path` to use a different bucket root. The songify
pitch cache lives beside the bucket root as `.pitch-cache.json`.

Download source media into a bucket's `videos/` folder before transcribing or
rendering. `yt-dlp` works well for pulling YouTube videos or playlists into the
expected local layout.

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:5180
```

For production-style serving:

```sh
npm run build
node build
```

Useful checks:

```sh
npm run check
```

## What's Here

- `/` - Library dashboard grouped by bucket. Shows video, mp3, transcript,
  size, word count, duration, per-row transcribe actions, and delete actions.
- `/clips` - Grid of rendered `.mp4` files from every bucket's `supercuts/`
  folder, with filtering, playback, download, and delete.
- `/supercut` - Phrase, regex, or AI-assisted regex supercut builder. Supports
  bucket selection, tile mode, clip limits, dry-run duration estimates, and
  debug text overlay.
- `/sentence` - Picks one clip per word and stitches a sentence they never said.
  Supports bucket selection, fixed seeds, morphology fallbacks, and debug
  overlay.
- `/songify` - Detects per-clip pitch with `aubiopitch` and arranges clips into
  a melody. Supports bucket selection, single-clip mode, and optional pitch
  shifting.
- `/transcribe` - Transcribes one file or all missing files in selected buckets
  through xAI speech-to-text. Extracts `.mp3` first when needed.
- `/stats` - Top words and n-grams across all bucket transcripts.

## Architecture Notes

- Routes live under [src/routes](src/routes); shared UI lives in [src/lib](src/lib).
- Bucket discovery and path safety live in
  [src/lib/server/paths.ts](src/lib/server/paths.ts).
- Pipelines live under
  [src/lib/server/pipelines](src/lib/server/pipelines) and accept an `onLog`
  callback for streaming progress.
- Jobs are tracked in an in-memory `Map` via
  [src/lib/server/jobs.ts](src/lib/server/jobs.ts). Restarting the server clears
  job history; finished outputs stay on disk.
- The UI polls `/api/jobs/[id]` while a job is running and can cancel jobs with
  `DELETE /api/jobs/[id]`.
- Media is served through
  [`/api/media/[bucket]/[kind]/[name]`](src/routes/api/media/%5Bbucket%5D/%5Bkind%5D/%5Bname%5D/+server.ts)
  with `Range` header support so `<video>` can seek without re-downloading.
- Library file deletion uses
  [`/api/library/[bucket]/[slug]`](src/routes/api/library/%5Bbucket%5D/%5Bslug%5D/+server.ts);
  rendered clip deletion uses
  [`/api/clips/[bucket]/[name]`](src/routes/api/clips/%5Bbucket%5D/%5Bname%5D/+server.ts).
- Supercut, sentence, and songify renders write into the first selected bucket's
  `supercuts/` folder. Multi-bucket outputs include `mixed` in the filename.

## Style Notes

- Global design tokens and reusable classes live in [src/app.css](src/app.css).
- Palette: `--bg` white, `--ink` near-black, single `--accent: #D0FE03`.
- [Unbounded](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Unbounded) is the main typeface;
  [JetBrains Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono) is used for
  logs and code-like text.
- Sections separate with whitespace or 1px rules. Status indicators use outlined
  or filled squares, not colored pills.
- The log panel is the primary inverted surface: black background with accent
  text.
